## Synopsis

A Xianxia inspired **incremental/idle** Game made in JS HTML
## How To

Cultivate, explore, fight and ultimately die to be reborn until you are at the top of the cultivation world.

## Motivation

This is a learning project for me that also combines 2 of my hobbies: Incremental games and Xianxia novels!

    DON'T BE A DICK PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

    Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a dick.

    Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

    1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name.
    1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a dick.
    1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER dick.

    If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work, share the love. Only a dick would make loads off this work and not buy the original work's creator(s) a pint.

    Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes you a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-dick would submit the fix back.
